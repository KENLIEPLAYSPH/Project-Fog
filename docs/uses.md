_Disclaimer! This is not a complete use case for the services, it is only based on my experience and how I use it. Feel free to DM me if I have incorrect information. I will correct it._
#
#### OCS Panel
_A webaite where you can create user account, access Openvpn Monitoring, V2ray, Openvpn Config._
#
#### OpenSSH
_OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. Most stable SSH client/server for Termux._
#
#### Dropbear
Alternative for OpenSSH. Comparing to OpenSSH, for speed and security, Dropbear wins.
#
#### Cerbot
Create certificates needed for V2ray setups.
#
#### Webmin
_If you prefer to manage all aspects of your Linux VPS or dedicated server from a graphical interface instead of the command line interface (CLI), Webmin might be right for you._
#
#### BadVPN
_Used to "socksify" TCP (IPv4 and IPv6) connections at the network layer. It implements a TUN virtual network interface which accepts all incoming TCP connections (regardless of destination IP), and forwards them through a SOCKS server. This allows you to forward all connections through SOCKS, without any need for application support._
Commonly use in KPN Tunnel and SocksHTTP
#
#### Openvpn Monitoring
Monitor who is connected to your server using Openvpn and where that connection originated.
#
#### Openvpn TCP and UDP
_Commonly used to hide your IP and can be changed depending on your Openvpn server._
UDP is best and stable for me but TCP can use remote proxy while UDP cannot.
#
#### Squid , Privoxy, OHP, Python Socks Proxy
_Serve as Remote Proxy._
#
#### Shadowsocks
_A free and open-source encryption protocol project, widely used in China to circumvent Internet censorship.
#
#### V2ray
_V2ray or vmess protocol to be precise, is a sophisticated version of the famous Shadowsocks. At the core v2ray is also based on SOCKS5 proxy._
#
#### Stunnel 
_Aproxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes in the programs' code. Commonly use in HTTP Injector, KPN tunnel, SocksHTTp and many more . ._
#
#### L2TP / IPSec PSK and IKE2
_Built-in VPN in android and IOS._
